# Cannabis Growing Plan Based on AGROTUCANO Experience

## Week 0-1: Germination & Early Seedling
- **Medium**: 
  - Use paper towel or cotton for germination
  - Prepare small pots with 60% nursery soil, 25% rice husks, 15% coconut substrate
- **Light**: 18 hours on/6 hours off
- **Water**: Keep seedling medium moist but not soggy

## Week 1-3: Early Vegetative
- **Container**: Transfer to 20L grow bags
- **Soil Mix**: 60% nursery soil, 25% rice husks, 15% coconut substrate
- **Water**: 5 minutes twice daily (morning/evening) via drip irrigation
- **Nutrients**: Light chicken manure mixed into soil
- **Maintenance**: Ensure light reaches all plants evenly

## Week 3-5: Mid Vegetative
- **Nutrients**: Add 50-100g urea per plant (dig shallow trench around plant, distribute evenly, cover lightly)
- **Pruning**: Perform "poda apical" (topping) when plants have 5-6 nodes
- **Water**: Increase to 10 minutes twice daily
- **Pest Control**: Start preventative spraying with candonga (0.5cc/L)

## Week 5-7: Late Vegetative
- **Nutrients**: Add Triple 15 fertilizer (100g per plant)
- **Maintenance**: Remove lower leaves ("deshojado")
- **Training**: Install trellis netting for support
- **Pest Control**: Regular inspection for spider mites, apply imidacloprid (1cc/L) + Pastik (1.5cc/L) if needed

## Week 7: Flip to Flower
- **Light**: Remove artificial lighting to trigger flowering
- **Nutrients**: Switch to Monster PK or similar high P-K fertilizer
- **Environment**: Maintain consistent watering schedule - DO NOT MISS IRRIGATION

## Week 8-13: Flowering
- **Nutrients**: Continue with PK nutrients, can add molasses (melaza agrícola)
- **Maintenance**: Continue removing excess fan leaves for better light penetration
- **Pest Control**: Apply fungicide (Switch or Luna Tranquility) to prevent bud rot
- **Water**: Maintain consistent watering - critical for flower development!

## Week 14-15: Harvest
- **Timing**: Harvest when trichomes are cloudy (use magnifying glass)
- **Method**: Cut main branches, remove large fan leaves

## Drying (7-14 days)
- **Environment**: Dark, cool space (18-20°C)
- **Humidity**: 50-60% first few days, gradually reduce to 40%
- **Airflow**: Good circulation but no direct fans on buds
- **Setup**: Hang branches upside down on string/wire

## Common Issues to Watch:
- Drip irrigation system failures - check daily
- Spider mites (especially in flowering) - prevention is key
- Uneven watering - ensure all plants get same amount
- Humidity spikes - causes mold in drying phase

This plan assumes autoflower seeds take ~10 weeks, photoperiod ~14-16 weeks total. Adjust based on specific strains!


# Essential Cannabis Cultivation Products

## Fertilizers

| Product | Components | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Urea** | 46-0-0 (N-P-K) | High nitrogen boost during vegetative growth; promotes leaf and stem development |
| **Triple 15** | 15-15-15 (N-P-K) | Balanced fertilizer for late vegetative stage; transition to flowering |
| **Monster PK** | High phosphorus & potassium | Flower/bud development; increases yield and potency |
| **Agricultural Molasses** (Melaza) | Carbohydrates, micronutrients | Feeds beneficial soil microbes; enhances terpene production during flowering |
| **Liquid Humus** | Humic/fulvic acids, beneficial microorganisms | Improves nutrient uptake; enhances soil biology |

## Pest & Disease Control

| Product | Components | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Candonga** | Abamectin 0.5% | Controls spider mites and other arthropod pests; preventative application |
| **Imidacloprid** | Neonicotinoid insecticide | Systemic insect control; effective against sucking insects |
| **Pastik** | Silicon-based surfactant | Enhances pesticide effectiveness; helps solution stick to leaves |
| **Luna Tranquility** | Fluopyram + Pyrimethanil | Fungicide that prevents powdery mildew and botrytis (bud rot) |
| **Switch** | Cyprodinil + Fludioxonil | Broad-spectrum fungicide; prevents various fungal diseases in flowering |

## Specialized Products

| Product | Components | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Agricultural Silicone** | Dimethylpolysiloxane | Wetting agent; reduces surface tension to improve nutrient/pesticide coverage |
| **Agricultural Hydrogen Peroxide** | H₂O₂ | Root zone oxygenation; prevents algae growth in irrigation systems |
| **Calcium-Magnesium Supplement** | Ca, Mg | Prevents deficiencies that cause leaf yellowing and affect bud formation |
| **pH Down** | Phosphoric acid | Adjusts irrigation water pH to optimal range (5.8-6.3) |

## Equipment Consumables

| Product | Components | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Trellis Netting** | Plastic/nylon mesh | Plant support during flowering; prevents branch breakage under bud weight |
| **Drip Irrigation Emitters** | Various flow rates (PCJ-type) | Consistent water delivery; prevents uneven watering issues |
| **Grow Bags** | Fabric/plastic (60L recommended) | Allows proper root development; better drainage than solid containers |

For best results in your AGROTUCANO setup, focus on the watering schedule consistency and early pest prevention - these were the main challenges in previous grows!
